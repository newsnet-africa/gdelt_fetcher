# GDELT Fetcher - Data Module

Core data fetching and processing infrastructure for the GDELT Fetcher library. Provides HTTP client functionality, file handling, and data parsing utilities.

## Project Status: Partially Implemented

The data module provides basic fetching infrastructure but requires significant development for production use.

## Completed Components

### Core Fetching Infrastructure
- [x] `DataFetcher` trait defining interface for async data fetching
- [x] Base GDELT fetcher implementations:
  - `GdeltFetcher` - Base implementation with configuration
  - `EventTableFetcher` - Specialized for GDELT Events
  - `MentionTableFetcher` - Specialized for GDELT Mentions
  - `GKGTableFetcher` - Specialized for Global Knowledge Graph
- [x] Table type classification system (`TableType` enum)
- [x] GDELT version handling (V1, V2 enumeration)
- [x] File extension abstractions (`FileExtension` trait with CSV/JSON support)

### Basic Infrastructure
- [x] Fetcher constructor patterns for different table types
- [x] Output and temporary directory configuration
- [x] Basic async fetching method signatures
- [x] Integration with models crate for type definitions
- [x] BigQuery fetcher structure (empty implementation)
