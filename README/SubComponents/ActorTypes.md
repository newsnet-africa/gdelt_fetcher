An Actor is an object created by the [[GDELT-Event_Codebook-V2.0.pdf|Event data stream]] from GDELT. Th is one of the 2 most important objects for us as it forms part of the core functionality of identifying and categorising events. Most people care more about the who and where than anything else, and so this type is going to be the richest. ActorTypes (or Roles, I think I called them Roles when I first made them) identify some specifics about the actor and context of what the actors job is (in the context of the article at least). The [[GDELT-Global_Knowledge_Graph_Codebook-V2.1.pdf| Knowledge Graph]] serves as a [[GDELT-Event_Codebook-V2.0.pdf#page=3&selection=6,6,8,0|Contextual database]] that adds richer data to actors of an event.
