# GDELT Fetcher

GDELT data fetching and processing library for the NewsNet decentralized news aggregation platform.

## Project Status: Basic Implementation Complete

The gdelt_fetcher crate provides foundational GDELT data access with basic fetching and parsing capabilities, but requires significant development for production use.

## Completed Components

### Main Library Interface
- [x] High-level convenience functions for fetching latest data:
  - `fetch_and_parse_events()` - Async function for latest GDELT events
  - `fetch_and_parse_mentions()` - Async function for latest mentions
  - `fetch_and_parse_gkg()` - Async function for Global Knowledge Graph data
- [x] Temporary directory management and cleanup utilities
- [x] Basic error handling with anyhow integration
- [x] Re-exports of core types and fetchers for convenience

### Data Models (models/ crate)
- [x] Complete type definitions for three main GDELT tables:
  - `EventTable` - Political, social, and conflict events
  - `MentionTable` - News mentions and source tracking
  - `GKGTable` - Global Knowledge Graph semantic data
- [x] GCAM (Global Content Analysis Measures) integration
  - Lookup types and code mappings
  - CSV parsing utilities
- [x] Rich type system with proper Rust representations
- [x] Serialization support with serde and bincode
- [x] Date/time handling with chrono integration

### Data Fetching (data/ crate)
- [x] Core fetching abstractions with `DataFetcher` trait
- [x] GDELT-specific fetcher implementations:
  - `EventTableFetcher` - Events data fetcher
  - `MentionTableFetcher` - Mentions data fetcher
  - `GKGTableFetcher` - GKG data fetcher
  - `GdeltFetcher` - Base implementation
- [x] File extension abstractions (CSV, JSON support planned)
- [x] GDELT version handling (V1, V2)
- [x] Table type enumeration and classification
- [x] Basic BigQuery fetcher structure (incomplete implementation)

### Utility Scripts
- [x] GCAM database population script (`populate_gcam_db.rs`)
- [x] CSV encoding fix utility (`fix_csv_encoding.rs`)
- [x] GCAM enrichment verification script (`verify_gcam_enrichment.rs`)
