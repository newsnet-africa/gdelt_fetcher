                <p>Just under a decade ago I showed how coupling web 
archiving with large scale automated change analysis could be used to 
track how the White House was quietly <a href="https://theboard.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/11/25/president-bushs-coalition-of-the-willing-or-orwell-comes-to-iraq/">rewriting</a> America’s history in realtime. The success of this model led to many other projects like Propublica’s <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/changetracker">ChangeTracker</a> and <a href="http://newsdiffs.org/">NewsDiffs</a>.
 Yet, beyond a few efforts focused on a small number of articles from a 
handful of mostly US outlets, there has been little focus on the grander
 question: planetary scale change detection for the global news media.</p>
<p>What would it look like to essentially perform a global “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diff">diff</a>”
 on a growing fraction of the entire daily output of the world’s online 
news outlets each day and each week to construct a running catalog of 
every change made to the online news coverage that forms the basis of 
our understanding of the world around us?</p>
<p>Such a catalog would allow us to see for the first time the extent of
 just how much of our online news landscape is rewritten on a daily 
basis, the kinds of changes that are made, whether there are specific 
topics or stories that endure greater rewriting or even deletion than 
others and to allow us to begin to quantify both the scope and impact of
 the growing practice of “stealth editing.”</p>
<p>Today we are immensely excited to announce the alpha release of the 
GDELT Global Difference Graph (GDG) that does exactly that. The GDG 
recrawls every news article monitored by GDELT after 24 hours and again 
after one week and compiles a running catalog of every change made to 
the article, from deletion to URL redirection to title changes to the 
article text itself being rewritten. When cataloging textual changes, 
only changes to the actual article text itself are considered – the 
surrounding navigation bars, headers, footers, trending sections, insets
 and other sections are excluded. This means that instead of flagging 
every time the trending stories box changes or an ad is rotated, the GDG
 only reflects actual changes to the story itself.</p>
<p>At a technical level, every 60 seconds the GDG compiles a list of 
every article monitored by GDELT during that one-minute period the 
previous day and 7 days prior and recrawls each of the URLs, checking 
for any changes. (Until GDELT 3.0 launches, the GDG will update every 
minute, but be largely limited to seeing new content only every 15 
minutes due to GDELT 2.0’s 15 minute update cycle). Changes in the title
 or body text are compiled using an optimized fast differencing engine 
that compares at either the “word” level (for space-delimited languages)
 or character level (currently for Burmese, Chinese, Dzongkha, Japanese,
 Khmer, Laothian, Thai, Tibetan and Vietnamese, with more being added as
 GDELT 3.0 launches). The text of any hyperlinks found in the article 
are included in the analysis, but text found in image captions is 
currently excluded to focus results on the body text (due to the number 
of outlets that only display partial captions and the high rate of 
caption editing on some sites resulting in large numbers of counter 
intuitive edits – we may add a dedicated "captions" category in future).</p>
<p>The GDG currently records four classes of change: download errors, 
redirects, title changes and text changes. Download errors record cases 
where the crawlers were unable to fetch the original page due to a 404, 
410 or 451 response (it is too difficult to separate other error classes
 from IP targeted responses or network transient errors, but we may 
expand the list of reported responses over time). Redirects record when 
the server redirects the client to a different URL (in which case the 
crawlers follow the redirect and continue their change analysis). Title 
changes reflect any edits made to the page title and text changes 
reflect edits made to the body text of the article itself. Pages that 
were found to be unchanged are recorded as either having exactly the 
same HTML code or having exactly the same text (in case the surrounding 
HTML of the page has changed, but the article text itself was not 
edited).</p>
<p>For web archives we also offer an <a href="http://data.gdeltproject.org/gdeltv3/gdg/RSS-GDG-15MINROLLUP.rss">RSS feed</a>
 that updates every 15 minutes and provides a list of all of the changed
 URLs identified over the previous 15 minutes. This makes it trivial for
 archivers to ensure they recrawl changed pages as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>In the end this is an alpha release so it is important to note that 
the results won’t always be perfect and we’d love your feedback, error 
reports, suggestions, etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>ALPHA RELEASE</strong></h2>
<p>This inaugural release of the GDELT Global Difference Graph (GDG) 
should be considered an alpha grade release. Based on user feedback and 
our own monitoring over time we will be continuing to improve this 
service as we roll it towards beta and may make breaking changes to the 
data format, assumptions, workflows and end points. It also means that 
while we have worked hard to make this service as accurate as possible, 
the sheer number of moving parts and the enormous complexity of tasks 
like document extraction at global scale mean there will always be some 
level of error in the resulting data. There may also be brief outages 
from time to time as we roll out major infrastructure changes to the 
system, finetune our crawler fleet and adjust outputs and assumptions. 
The alpha GDG release also enforces a versioning requirement on document
 extraction upgrades that means that after major updates to our 
extraction infrastructure there will be a 24 hour pause on text change 
comparisons (see the section below for more details), which will be 
removed as we move towards beta.</p>
<p>To put it more succinctly, we’ve done our best to create a service 
that is as accurate as we can make it and that we think will be 
tremendously powerful for understanding the fluidity of the global news 
landscape, but just keep in mind that as an alpha release there will be a
 certain level of roughness around the edges and errors.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>ACCURACY</strong></h2>
<p>The GDG identifies a number of different kinds of changes to articles. Server errors (currently only 404, 410 and <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/7019674/genoa-bridge-collapse-lorry-teetering-on-edge-of-italy-motorway-was-forced-to-brake-when-car-overtook-then-watched-driver-plunge-150ft/">451</a>
 errors) are recorded as-is from the remote server. It is important to 
remember that many kinds of errors may be transient and errors like “403
 Forbidden” or a timeout may be unique to a specific crawler’s 
interaction with the server rather than a broader error response. 
GDELT’s crawler fleet is distributed across Google’s immense global data
 center footprint, meaning at any given moment a new crawler might 
launch on an IP address that previously belonged to a different user 
that was blocked by a given site, inadvertently affecting that crawler 
for the duration of its life (typically 30 minutes to an hour) or may 
encounter a limited temporary issue with the remote server that causes 
it to timeout or receive a server error. Transient network errors can 
also result in a code 200 response that disconnects before the page 
content itself is transferred. Most permanent error responses like 404’s
 will not change, but keep in mind that the GDG merely reports the 
experience of our crawlers when attempting to access the page at that 
specific instant in time and you may see different results from your 
specific IP addresses. For precision tasks you may wish to feed error 
URLs into your own crawlers to test yourself.</p>
<p>GDG crawlers use a 30 second timeout to give the best possible chance
 to very slow websites. For timeouts and 500-series errors, the crawlers
 will retry the URL a second time using a brand-new connection and allow
 for another 30 second window to receive the results.</p>
<p>To perform cross-domain or longitudinal analyses, use the 
UNCHANGED_HTML and UNCHANGED_TEXT statuses (documented below) as a 
normalization factor, comparing the number of statuses indicating 
content changes to the number of UNCHANGED_* statuses. This way if a 
site has a problem where most requests time out for a few hours and 
there are only a handful of change reports during that period, you can 
see from the low number of UNCHANGED_* statuses during those hours that 
the reduced number of change reports is not a result of the site 
performing less editing, but rather than our total monitoring volume 
from that site was reduced during that period of time.</p>
<p>When evaluating change reports, especially those involving large 
scale changes to an article’s text, it is important to consider whether 
the page also has a redirection status indicating that the original URL 
now redirects to a new URL. In the vast majority of cases redirections 
point to an updated version of the article, but in some cases sites may 
redirect to administrative pages, such as this <a href="http://kfmx.com/alstrom-angels-hosting-fundraising-dinner/">article</a> that now <a href="http://kfmx.com/gdpr/consent/">redirects</a>
 to a GDPR compliance page (instead of just displaying the notice as a 
popover on the original page like most sites), which causes a page text 
changed status to report that the entire article text has been replaced.
 Some sites also do not correctly return 404’s for deleted pages and 
instead return 200 with a page describing in textual or visual terms to 
the user that the original page no longer exists. This can cause the 
page text changed status to report the entire page has changed. Checking
 the replacement text for boilerplate mentions of "404" or a "page not 
being found" error in its respective language can help identify these 
cases.</p>
<p>Given the simplicity of extracting page titles, changes to title text
 identified by the GDG can typically be trusted as-is. For precision 
tasks it is important to note that GDELT combines the HTML 
&lt;TITLE&gt;&lt;/TITLE&gt; tags with other elements of the page like 
the OG:TITLE and other attributes to determine the “best” title and 
handle TITLE tag abuses by some sites, as well as attempting to remove 
extraneous elements like the site name from the title. However, in 
nearly all cases title changes can be accepted as accurate. This can 
include the actual <a href="http://www.zocalo.com.mx/reforma/detail/dispara-pdi-a-sospechoso-le-da-a-peaton">removal</a> of a page’s title, in which for unknown reasons a page that formerly had a title is republished without its title.</p>
<p>Article body text changes, on the other hand, are entirely dependent 
on the ability of the document extraction infrastructure’s ability to 
correctly, robustly and repeatably extract the article text from the 
rest of the page and do so with absolute stable precision.</p>
<p>There are many factors that can negatively affect our ability to 
precisely extract the body text, introducing error, particularly around 
the exact start and stop boundaries of the text and the removal of 
insets, allowing extraneous content to slip in that may change between 
page fetches. For example, the server might truncate sections of the 
page without reporting a problem. If a sufficient number of critical 
sections are removed, that may impact how we see the page or even remove
 the text entirely if it is buried at the bottom of a lengthy HTML page 
that is truncated. Major structural changes to the page can impact the 
extractor’s ability to correctly locate document boundaries. In extreme 
cases a temporary misconfiguration of a server or CMS template might 
cause sufficiently large blocks of badly encoded text to be injected 
into a page (or even corrupt the encoding of the entire page) that it 
interferes with our ability to correctly detect and decode the 
characterset encoding of the page, leading us to incorrectly detect the 
entire page as changed. In practice, certain changes to a page may cause
 our extraction infrastructure to change its estimates of what precisely
 constitutes the body of an article, allowing small amounts of unrelated
 text to seep in that may change between page fetches.</p>
<p>In short, the sheer magnitude of the number of moving parts involved 
in correctly and precisely extracting each article’s body text across 
the incredible stylistic, technical and linguistic diversity of the 
world’s news outlets means there are necessarily going to be a certain 
percentage of errors in our extractions, no matter how accurate they 
are. Stable errors are those that persist despite small changes to the 
page between fetches. Unstable errors are those where small but critical
 changes to the page can yield small changes to the extracted text’s 
start and end boundaries and inset removal, leading to false positive 
change detections.</p>
<p>For example, some sites have quirks in their HTML that can make them 
difficult to properly extract, such as embedded “popover” text that is 
rendered in HTML as standard body text, with JavaScript code that 
dynamically hides it at runtime or “last updated” text that reports how 
many hours it has been since the page was published and is integrated 
into the body text with no styling or other visual or structural 
indicators to allow it to be separated.</p>
<p>In the end this means that not all changes the algorithms detect are 
correct – there will always be a certain percentage of false positives. 
For precision comparison needs, we recommend you manually compare the 
current version of the page against a historical version and search for 
the changes we report. Since 2014 GDELT has sent a realtime <a href="https://blog.gdeltproject.org/archiving-the-world-gdelt-joins-the-internet-archives-no-more-404-initiative/">stream</a>
 of all of the URLs we monitor to the Internet Archive for ingestion 
into their Wayback Machine, which as of last November totaled more than 
221TB across 5.3 billion URLS. However, there can be a delay of several 
hours between the URL being received by the Archive and when they are 
able to crawl it, meaning that changes made in the first hour or two 
after publication may not be reflected in the Archive’s version of the 
page. We are currently working on several fronts to make it easier to 
manually verify changes for high precision use cases.</p>
<p>Caveats aside, in the majority of cases when you see a text change 
recorded in the GDG it means there was a legitimate change to the 
article’s text.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>DOCUMENT EXTRACTION INFRASTRUCTURE UPGRADES</strong></h2>
<p>Correctly and robustly extracting the body text of a news article 
from the rest of the page text and doing so accurately at planetary 
scale, spanning a growing fraction of accessible online news outlets in 
every country and more than 65 languages requires an immensely complex 
and powerful document extraction infrastructure that we are constantly 
improving over time. Ordinarily these continual improvements are 
invisible – the quality of extractions just continues to improve over 
time. Periodically however, we release substantial upgrades that 
materially improve handling for a large number of cases. These kinds of 
large changes create a problem when comparing the article text extracted
 today using the upgraded infrastructure from the article text extracted
 yesterday using the original infrastructure – the changes between the 
two text versions may merely reflect adjustments in the functioning of 
the algorithm rather than legitimate changes to the article itself.</p>
<p>To address this, the alpha GDG release will only compare versions of 
an article that were extracted using the same document extraction 
infrastructure versions. This means that when we roll out a major 
upgrade to the extraction infrastructure, the version numbers of its 
various components will change. If we release an upgrade today, the GDG 
crawlers will immediately begin extracting using the new codebase, but 
the version signature of the extracted text won’t match that of the 
previous versions of the article extracted yesterday and one week ago. 
In this case, the GDG crawlers will still perform the HTTP and HTML 
checks but will not proceed to document extraction and title and text 
comparison.</p>
<p>Thus, during the alpha phase, any major upgrade to the extraction 
infrastructure will mean a 24-hour period from that point forward where 
the GDG system will not perform title or text comparison checks. After 
24 hours the versions of the articles being dispatched for their 24-hour
 check will now match the previous version and the comparisons will 
resume and after one week the weekly checks will resume as well.</p>
<p>As we progress through the alpha phase towards beta we are working on
 a fallback infrastructure that will allow the GDG crawlers to directly 
fetch the previous original HTML and reperform document extraction using
 the new engine so that the results are matched. This approach poses 
considerable infrastructure and computational requirements and so likely
 will not be implemented until the beta release but we hope to have such
 dynamic reextraction in place for beta.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>TECHNICAL DETAILS AND FILE FORMAT</strong></h2>
<p>The GDG is available as either newline delimited JSON files, produced
 once per minute or as a BigQuery table updated every 15 minutes. The 
BigQuery table is loaded directly from the JSON files so mirrors their 
format precisely. An additional RSS feed of the changed URLs is also 
available.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>JSON Files</strong>. All files are in newline delimited 
gzipped UTF8 JSON format and available at 
http://data.gdeltproject.org/gdeltv3/gdg/YYYYMMDDHHMMSS.gdg.v3.json.gz, 
starting from the first file <a href="http://data.gdeltproject.org/gdeltv3/gdg/20180827133100.gdg.v3.json.gz">http://data.gdeltproject.org/gdeltv3/gdg/20180827133100.gdg.v3.json.gz</a>
 and running through one minute ago. The “SS” (seconds) component of the
 date is always zero and the files are added one per minute. To download
 all of the available files, iterate from the first file to one minute 
ago in one-minute increments. Note that due to the 15 minute update 
cycle of GDELT 2.0, the GDG receives a new batch of URLs every 15 
minutes and may finish them after a few minutes, meaning there may be 
gaps of no files when it was waiting for new URLs between input batches,
 so be aware that there are many missing minute files representing 
periods of no data.</li>
<li><strong>BigQuery</strong>. The entire dataset is also available as a public BigQuery table as <a href="https://bigquery.cloud.google.com/table/gdelt-bq:gdeltv2.gdg_partitioned?pli=1">gdelt-bq:gdeltv2.gdg_partitioned</a>
 and is partitioned on the “fetchdate_check” field to allow you to 
minimize the amount of data you have to query. The BigQuery table is 
populated directly from the JSON files, so is an exact duplicate in 
terms of the meaning of each of the fields.</li>
<li><strong>RSS Feed</strong>. For web archives and others that want a continual updating stream of changed URLs, there is also an RSS 2.0 feed at <a href="http://data.gdeltproject.org/gdeltv3/gdg/RSS-GDG-15MINROLLUP.rss">http://data.gdeltproject.org/gdeltv3/gdg/RSS-GDG-15MINROLLUP.rss</a>
 that updates every 15 minutes (typically a few minutes after :00, :15, 
:30 and :45 after the hour) and contains a list of all of the URLs that 
the GDG detected in the last 15 minutes as having changed in some 
fashion since they were originally crawled. The feed contains only those
 URLs found in the last 15 minutes, meaning it must be monitored every 
15 minutes (ideally at :05, :20, :35 and :50 minutes after the hour to 
give room in case it takes the system a minute or two to generate the 
file). At this time the feed includes all URLs that were flagged as 
having any kind of change, so for archives that wish to record only 
specific kinds of changes (such as only 404’s), they should process the 
JSON files and filter based on the status code.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The JSON format is relatively simple. Each JSON file contains a 
series of records, one per line, that document a specific page status 
observed by the GDG system. A page status might indicate that the HTML 
of the page is unchanged, that the HTML is changed, but the text has not
 been edited, that the title has changed, that the URL now redirects to a
 new URL or that the URL now yields a error, among other indicators. 
Each record includes a “status” field that indicates the type of status 
it represents and then a series of additional fields distinct to that 
status. Some fields are present in all statuses, while many are present 
only in some statuses. A given URL may have multiple entries in the JSON
 file reflecting multiple observed status changes. For example, a URL 
that now redirects to a new URL and has edits to its title and body text
 would appear as three separate rows in the JSON file, one each for the 
redirect, title and body text changes.</p>
<p>The table below is organized by the value of the “status” field and 
shows under each status the fields that are present (though some fields 
may be blank).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>HTTP_ERROR</strong>. This indicates a fatal error in 
retrieving the page. Since the page content could not be successfully 
downloaded, no further analysis will be performed. Presently only code 
404, 410 and 451 errors are returned – all other errors are too 
transient or related to potential IP targeting to reliably return at 
this time, though we will likely update this list over time.
<ul>
<li><strong>page_url</strong>. The URL of the article being checked.</li>
<li><strong>page_title</strong>. The original title of the article.</li>
<li><strong>page_domain_full</strong>. The full domain of the article, including all subdomains (such as “arabic.cnn.com”).</li>
<li><strong>page_domain_root</strong>. The root domain of the article, minus subdomains (“arabic.cnn.com” would be recorded as just “cnn.com” in this field).</li>
<li><strong>page_lang</strong>. The human readable name of the language the article is written in (as detected when it was first crawled).</li>
<li><strong>fetchdate_orig</strong>. The precise UTC time (to the second) that the article was originally crawled.</li>
<li><strong>fetchdate_check</strong>. The precise UTC time (to the second) that the article was crawled by the GDG system to perform the comparison check.</li>
<li><strong>http_code</strong>. The HTTP code reported by the server.</li>
<li><strong>http_size</strong>. The total number of bytes returned by the server.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>HTTP_REDIRECT</strong>. This indicates that when the URL was
 fetched, the server redirected the client to a new URL. Redirects that 
purely change from HTTP to HTTPS or only insert a “www” at the front of 
the domain name or a slash at the end of the URL are not reflected here.
 The GDG crawler automatically follows the redirect to the new URL and 
otherwise treats it as a normal URL, meaning that an article that 
appears with this code will still be checked for title and content 
changes. In the case that a server redirects the client multiple times, 
only the final redirected URL is recorded.
<ul>
<li><strong>page_url</strong>. The URL of the article being checked.</li>
<li><strong>page_title</strong>. The original title of the article.</li>
<li><strong>page_domain_full</strong>. The full domain of the article, including all subdomains (such as “arabic.cnn.com”).</li>
<li><strong>page_domain_root</strong>. The root domain of the article, minus subdomains (“arabic.cnn.com” would be recorded as just “cnn.com” in this field).</li>
<li><strong>page_lang</strong>. The human readable name of the language the article is written in (as detected when it was first crawled).</li>
<li><strong>fetchdate_orig</strong>. The precise UTC time (to the second) that the article was originally crawled.</li>
<li><strong>fetchdate_check</strong>. The precise UTC time (to the second) that the article was crawled by the GDG system to perform the comparison check.</li>
<li><strong>http_code</strong>. The HTTP code reported by the server.</li>
<li><strong>http_size</strong>. The total number of bytes returned by the server.</li>
<li><strong>redirect_url</strong>. The final URL the client was redirected to. In the case of multiple redirects, only the last one is recorded.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>UNCHANGED_HTML</strong>.&nbsp;This indicates that the HTML 
of the entire article page remains unchanged. Since this necessarily 
indicates that there are no content changes to the page, the comparison 
process is ended for the article at this point.
<ul>
<li><strong>page_url</strong>. The URL of the article being checked.</li>
<li><strong>page_title</strong>. The original title of the article.</li>
<li><strong>page_domain_full</strong>. The full domain of the article, including all subdomains (such as “arabic.cnn.com”).</li>
<li><strong>page_domain_root</strong>. The root domain of the article, minus subdomains (“arabic.cnn.com” would be recorded as just “cnn.com” in this field).</li>
<li><strong>page_lang</strong>. The human readable name of the language the article is written in (as detected when it was first crawled).</li>
<li><strong>fetchdate_orig</strong>. The precise UTC time (to the second) that the article was originally crawled.</li>
<li><strong>fetchdate_check</strong>. The precise UTC time (to the second) that the article was crawled by the GDG system to perform the comparison check.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>UNCHANGED_CONTENT</strong>. This indicates that the HTML of 
the page changed, but that neither the title nor the article text 
changed. Typically this means a change to headers, footers, related 
content insets, etc.
<ul>
<li>Same fields as <strong>UNCHANGED_HTML</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>PAGE_TITLECHANGE.&nbsp;</strong>This indicates that one or 
more changes were detected in the page title. If the body text also 
changed there will also be a separate entry for PAGE_TEXTCHANGE.
<ul>
<li><strong>page_url</strong>. The URL of the article being checked.</li>
<li><strong>page_title</strong>. The original title of the article.</li>
<li><strong>page_domain_full</strong>. The full domain of the article, including all subdomains (such as “arabic.cnn.com”).</li>
<li><strong>page_domain_root</strong>. The root domain of the article, minus subdomains (“arabic.cnn.com” would be recorded as just “cnn.com” in this field).</li>
<li><strong>page_lang</strong>. The human readable name of the language the article is written in (as detected when it was first crawled).</li>
<li><strong>fetchdate_orig</strong>. The precise UTC time (to the second) that the article was originally crawled.</li>
<li><strong>fetchdate_check</strong>. The precise UTC time (to the second) that the article was crawled by the GDG system to perform the comparison check.</li>
<li><strong>title_new</strong>. The new title of the article.</li>
<li><strong>num_changes</strong>. The total number of “changes” in the 
page where a change is a run of text that can be a single word/character
 or a large block of them.</li>
<li><strong>change_unit</strong>. This will either be “word” indicating 
that the document was split into “words” (specifically the text is 
divided on spans of spaces) or “char” indicating that the document was 
split into individual characters (specifically the Unicode definition of
 a discrete “character” in the given language). For space-segmented 
languages, word-level comparison yields more semantically meaningful 
results, while character-level segmentation ensures fidelity to the 
original text for non-space-segmented languages (since word segmentation
 algorithms are imperfect and would introduce error to the process).</li>
<li><strong>from_numchars</strong>. Total length of the original text in characters.</li>
<li><strong>to_numchars</strong>. Total length of the new text in characters.</li>
<li><strong>from_changedchars</strong>. Total number of characters of the original text that were replaced.</li>
<li><strong>to_changedchars</strong>. Total number of characters of the new text that were different from the original.</li>
<li><strong>tot_changedchars</strong>. Total number of characters changed in both the original and new text (calculated as “from_changedchars + to_changedchars”).</li>
<li><strong>perc_changedchars</strong>. Percent of the total number of 
characters in both the original and new text that changed (calculated as
 “tot_changedchars / (from_numchars + to_numchars)”).</li>
<li><strong>changes</strong>. This is a JSON array that contains a 
series of objects representing each of the individual changes identified
 by the differencing algorithm.
<ul>
<li>This is the first 75 characters of the original text block (text longer than this is truncated with a “…” added to the end).</li>
<li>This is the first 75 characters of the new text block that replaced 
it (text longer than this is truncated with a “…” added to the end).</li>
<li><strong>from_range</strong>. This has the format “start-end” and 
records the starting token position and ending token position of the 
text in the original version that was changed. If “change_unit” is 
“word” this will record word offsets, otherwise character offsets. 
Offsets begin with 0. A single word change will result in both start and
 end having the same value. A value of “3-3” with “change_unit” being 
“word” means that word position 3 (the fourth word in the document since
 offsets begin with 0) was replaced. A value of “0-3” means the words at
 positions 0, 1, 2 and 3 were all replaced (a four word span). The 
purpose of this field is to allow you to understand where approximately 
in the text the change occurred (at the start, at the end, in the 
middle, etc) and its length in words or characters to estimate its 
overall size.</li>
<li><strong>to_range</strong>. Same format and meaning as “from_range” but applies to the replacement text.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>PAGE_TEXTCHANGE</strong>. This indicates that one or more 
changes were detected in the article text. If the page title also 
changed there will also be a separate entry for PAGE_TITLECHANGE.
<ul>
<li>Same fields as <strong>PAGE_TITLECHANGE</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>We’re tremendously excited by the potential this incredible new 
dataset offers and we can’t wait to see what you are able to do with it!</p>
